# Incorporating-AI-Driven-Myoelectric-Signal-Adaptability-for-Elderly-Assistive-Robots-at-Multi-Levels

# File Description 

The **'KD.ipynb'** is the training code for knowledge distillation (KD).

The **'KD_test.ipynb'** is the testing code for knowledge distillation.

The trained complete KD model is saved in  **'./checkpoint/'**.

The **'model_teacher_S.h5'** is the teacher model using in KD training.

The **'student_.h5'** is the obtained student model after KD.

The hand-elbow motion combination data at the functional level is placed in **'./data_hand_and_elbow/'**.

The wok control data at the behavioral level is placed in **'./data_wok/'**.

The **'utilities'** can process EMG signals to sliding windows. 

# Environment
The scripts are carried on Tensorflow-v2.



# Usage
This testing script is carried on Tensorflow-v2.

**Run the script 'test_result' to test the prediction performance of an example subject**. 

The accuracy and RÂ² are calculated and printed. 

The comparison of true labels and prediction results are displayed on three figures and saved in **'Result_figures'**.
